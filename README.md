The SendMMS method initiated from within the SendMessageActivity.java that has been copied to this public repository at https://github.com/tpoffice1/testing1 is here for the purpose of introduction. It isn't working correctly according to the prior developer who said that only Google can fix it. He said that the workaround is to find or write another API which seems dangerous to me from a personal security standpoint. I don't want there to be anything in the code that interacts directly with my account until it is running on my phone only and I give I select the Google account for it to work with. The previous developer has not communicated well enough for me to fully understand what is happening and he has some logistical problems that won't allow him be in front of a computer and online when I need him to be.
