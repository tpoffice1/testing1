The SendMMS method initiated from within the SendMessageActivity.java that has been copied to this public repository at https://github.com/tpoffice1/testing1 is here for the purpose of introduction. It isn't working correctly according to the prior developer who said that only Google can fix it. 

He said that the workaround is to find or write another API which seems dangerous to me from a personal security standpoint. 

I don't want there to be anything in the code that interacts directly with my account until it is running on my phone only and I give I select the Google account for it to work with. 

I don't yet fully understand what is happening on the side of the developer and he has some logistical problems that won't allow him be in front of a computer and online when needed. 

I need some additional eyes on what is broken within the SendMMS method through CodeTogether which will allow you to emulate, test, edit, and compile directly from within my IDE.

Co-Pilot has suggested the following changes to improve the debugging process.

To modify the sendMMS method to ensure it works correctly, you can follow these steps:  
Check for permissions: Ensure the app has the necessary permissions to send SMS.
Convert Bitmaps to Uri: Convert the Bitmap images to Uri objects.
Create and send the MMS: Use an Intent to send the MMS with the images attached.
Here is the updated sendMMS method:
private void sendMMS(ArrayList<Bitmap> images) {
    if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.SEND_SMS) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
        requestPermissionLauncher.launch(Manifest.permission.SEND_SMS);
        return;
    }

    ArrayList<Uri> imageUris = new ArrayList<>();
    for (Bitmap bitmap : images) {
        Uri imageUri = getImageUri(this, bitmap);
        if (imageUri != null) {
            imageUris.add(imageUri);
        }
    }

    Intent sendIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE);
    sendIntent.setType("image/*");
    sendIntent.putParcelableArrayListExtra(Intent.EXTRA_STREAM, imageUris);
    sendIntent.putExtra("address", "+1234567890");
    sendIntent.putExtra("sms_body", "Here are the images");

    try {
        startActivity(sendIntent);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        Log.e("MMS", "sendMMS: " + e.getMessage());
        Toast.makeText(this, "Failed to send MMS", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
}

private Uri getImageUri(Context context, Bitmap bitmap) {
    String path = MediaStore.Images.Media.insertImage(context.getContentResolver(), bitmap, "Image", null);
    return path != null ? Uri.parse(path) : null;
}
Permission check: Ensure the SEND_SMS permission is granted.
Convert Bitmaps to Uri: Use the getImageUri method to convert Bitmap images to Uri objects.
Create and send the MMS: Use an Intent with ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE to send the MMS with the images attached.
